This project was a recent skills assessment and has two main functionalities:

1. Allows users to search for any public GitHub organization and returns select details for all of its public members.
2. Allows users to search for any GitHub user and returns every public repository that they have committed to, along with the number of commits they have made and the date of their last commit.

You can find the project hosted at the following domain:

Use the search bars to search for any GitHub organization or user.
